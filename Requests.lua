-- people who ask for a buff
--
-- "int pls", "fort?", "can I get motw", "buffs please" -- said in /say, /yell,
-- your group's chat or a whisper -- put whoever said it on the prompt, reading
-- "asked for it", for a minute. Nothing is ever said back. The rules are kept
-- simple enough to say on the options page, and err towards silence:
--
--   * eight words at most; anything longer is a conversation.
--   * it names the buff in whole words, by a name players use (ASK_NAMES) or
--     the spell's own name on this client, which covers other languages.
--     "buff" or "buffs" names every buff you have.
--   * nothing in it says no.
--   * it reads as a request: a please or "need" anywhere, an opener (can, any,
--     anyone...), or nothing but the name and filler ("int me"). A buff's name
--     (not a looser word, not "buff") is also asked for by a closing question
--     mark, unless the message opens as a question about it ("who has int?").
--
-- A one-word nickname and "buff" are everyday words too ("int" is an
-- interrupt), so beside one every other word must be a small one. The looser
-- words (might, mark, shout...) need a please or to stand alone, and never
-- count in group chat, where "mark pls" is about raid markers.
--
-- Chat text and senders can be secret values on this client; a secret is
-- never compared, matched or kept, so an unreadable message is no request.
--
-- A request names a person, not a unit: the queue matches it against every
-- unit it walks, and there is no tokenless fallback (a whisper, unlike a
-- favour, is no evidence of range). It is offered only while they lack it.
--
-- The section sits in one do-block, hanging its entry points off ns, because
-- the main chunk is close to the 200 locals Lua 5.1 allows a function.
