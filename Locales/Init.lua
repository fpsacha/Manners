-- Every player-facing string goes through ns.L, keyed by its English text:
--
--   print(L["Nobody to buff right now."])
--   print(L["%s buffed you"]:format(name))
--
-- A string with no translation for the client's language comes back as its
-- own key, so English needs no file of its own and a string added after the
-- last translation pass still reads correctly, in English, rather than as a
-- blank or an error.
--
-- The locale files after this one each fill the table only when the client
-- runs in their language. They set values and nothing else; tests/validate.py
-- checks that every translation keeps its format specifiers, {tokens} and
-- colour codes in the same order as the English, because a translation that
-- drops a %s throws in string.format at the moment the line is printed.
