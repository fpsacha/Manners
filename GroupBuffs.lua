-- Wild) -- on Forever the caster's whole party and raid (ns.GROUP_IS_RAID) --
-- or for a paladin everybody of the target's class in the raid or party (the
-- Greater Blessings), each for a reagent. When the player knows it, carries
-- the reagent (or, on Forever, has the perk that waives it: ReagentWaived),
-- and enough of one party (or raid, or class) are waiting for the single
-- buff, BuildQueue gets one entry for the group cast instead of theirs.
--
-- The entry is aimed at one of them, the anchor, so the macro, the settle and
-- the ledger see a person as they always have. What it adds is `groupCast`:
-- the spell, the reagent, and everybody else the cast covers, which PostClick,
-- the settle and the ledger read. Everybody it covered drops off the prompt
-- the way anybody buffed does: their auras read the buff once it lands.
