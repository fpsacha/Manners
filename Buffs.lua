-- Manners -- what each class can put on somebody else.
--
-- The clients do not agree about a single spell, so the tables are per
-- flavour, chosen at the bottom of this file from ns.Flavour (Flavour.lua is
-- named before this file in every toc).
--
-- The fields, which mean the same thing in every set:
--
--   ranks     the castable spells, highest first. The macro casts by name, so
--             the game picks the best rank you know; the list is for aura
--             matching and for "do you know this at all". Only the vanilla
--             and Burning Crusade sets have more than one (ranks were removed
--             game-wide in 4.0.1).
--   group     every other id that counts as this buff already being there:
--             the raid-wide version on vanilla, or the thirteen per-class
--             auras Blessing of the Bronze applies on retail. Matched exactly
--             as the ranks are, through buff.auraIds.
--   alike     another class's buffs that do the same and do not stack with
--             this one (Mists' raid-buff kinds: Kings, Mark of the Wild and
--             Legacy of the Emperor are all 5% stats): somebody wearing one is
--             covered, by somebody else, and a cast of ours would change
--             nothing. Matched through buff.auraIds after the ranks and the
--             group, never filed under this buff (BUFF_BY_ID): a favour of
--             one is still that class's buff.
--   blockers  the auras another source puts on somebody that the game compares
--             with this buff's own: a flat stat. Arcane Intellect, Power Word:
--             Fortitude and Divine Spirit are each a MOD_STAT aura (29) on one
--             stat (Intellect 3, Stamina 2, Spirit 4 in EffectMiscValue), and so
--             are the Scrolls of Intellect, Stamina and Spirit; only the greater
--             of two such auras stays on somebody, and a cast of the lesser is
--             refused ("A more powerful spell is already active"). Listed are
--             the spells the scrolls cast; what they give, and what every rank
--             of the buff gives, is the set's `statValue`. UnitHasBuff
--             (Core.lua) reads them when the buff itself is not worn: one worth
--             at least what the rank your cast would land on them gives covers
--             them, a lesser one is cast over. Only where the buff's ranks are
--             such an aura: the sets whose stat buffs are percentages (Mists,
--             retail) have none, and no table.
--   manaOnly  only worth giving somebody with a mana bar.
--   partyOnly reaches your party and nobody else.
--   groupOnly reaches anybody in your party or raid (a raid member in another
--             subgroup too), and nobody outside it: Blessing of Salvation.
--   selfCast  cast on yourself, not on them, so the macro takes no target.
--   neverAuto offerable, but never what "Automatic" reaches for.
--   strongest the buff of an exclusive class's list (a paladin's Kings) that
--             "Blessing of Kings first" puts at the head of the walk: offered to
--             everybody before the rest, which stay in their order behind it
--             and are what somebody gets who cannot be given it or already
--             wears it from another paladin (Core.lua, CastableBuffs). Set only
--             where the list does not already begin with it: Mists' does.
--   notSelf   the game will not let you cast it on yourself, so "Myself"
--             (Queue.lua) never offers it to you.
--   neverSelf castable on yourself, but never offered to you by "Myself": a
--             buff you want only for a reason the prompt cannot see (Unending
--             Breath, under water), which would come back every time it ran
--             out, all evening. Offers to others are untouched.
--   alone     lands on its target alone, on a set whose casts on somebody in
--             your party or raid land on every one of them (wideCasts).
--   talent    learned from a talent, so not everybody of the class knows it:
--             "Skip my own class" never skips it (Queue.lua, SelfServed).
--             ns.AskedFor still turns away every ask from your own class,
--             talent or not.
--   groupCast the version one cast puts on a whole party (or, for a paladin,
--             on everybody of one class), as { id, reagent } per rank, highest
--             first. Only the rank the player knows best is ever used, because
--             the macro casts by name and the game picks that rank. Offered in
--             place of single casts by GroupBuffs.lua.
--
-- How long each lasts is no field of a buff: it is a table of ids per client, below
-- ("how long each lasts"), which a top-up's lead is worked out from (Core.lua).
--
-- Only buffs worth giving a passer-by are listed: emergency spells (Blessing
-- of Freedom, Protection) and anything that moves somebody (Slow Fall,
-- Levitate, Water Walking) are deliberately absent.

-- weapon enhancements: poisons, stones, oils and lures
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What goes on a weapon from the bags and wears off: a rogue's poisons, a
-- sharpening stone or a weightstone, a wizard or mana oil, a fishing lure on a
-- pole. On the clients that have them as items (Classic Era, Burning Crusade,
-- Mists and Forever) each is one of your own buffs of a kind apart from the
-- spells: an item, as a mage's scroll is, used with /use item:<id> and aimed at
-- the hand with /use 16 or /use 17 in the same press (Prompt/Macro.lua), and
-- "up" when that hand carries an enchant (Core.lua, ReadImbue). Classic Era,
-- Burning Crusade and Mists give one temporary enchant to a hand, whichever
-- made it, so any one counts and no other kind is asked for over it. WoW
-- Forever's client lists every enchant on a hand with its kind
-- (Enum.ItemEnchantType) and keeps one of each kind on a hand at once: a
-- shaman's Rockbiter Weapon is an Imbue and a wizard oil a Temporary
-- enchant, and both stay on. So there a family is up only when its hand
-- carries an enchant of its own kind (`enchantKind`, below). Mists and retail
-- give a rogue's poisons as spells instead (MISTS_OWN and MAINLINE_SET,
-- below).
--
-- A family is one kind of enhancement for one hand: Poison for the main hand
-- and again for the off hand, each with a pick of its own, since a rogue keeps
-- one poison on each. Beside the fields of the scroll families (below), with
-- `scroll` set because its spells are items:
--
--   enhance   a weapon enhancement: read per hand, never from an aura
--   kind      poison, stone, oil or lure
--   slot      the hand it is for, as an inventory slot: 16 main, 17 off
--   only      the one class it is offered to (a rogue's poisons); every
--             class carrying one of its items otherwise
--   enchantKind  what the family's enchants are listed as, where the spells
--             below do not say otherwise (the field of the same name)
--
-- and per spell, one for each item, best first (the order Automatic tries
-- them in before you have used one; a stone made for any weapon first, then
-- by rank):
--
--   item      the item id
--   level     the level it asks to be used at (ItemSparse RequiredLevel)
--   enchant   the enchant it makes (SpellItemEnchantment), which says which
--             of them is on the weapon, and so what a top-up would be
--   ranks     { the spell its use casts }, which settles the press
--   fits      the weapons it fits, as the use spell's SpellEquippedItems
--             subclass mask: one bit per kind of weapon (Core.lua, Fits)
--   since     the first build of the client that has the item, where it is
--             newer than the build the other data was read from
--   enchantKind  Forever only, on the spell where it is not its family's: how
--             that client lists the enchant the item makes, "imbue" or
--             "temporary". It is the use spell's SpellEffect: 360 an imbue,
--             54 a temporary enchant (wago.tools, 1.60.1.70532, where the
--             `since` items exist; tools/audit_ids.py holds every one to it). Poisons are imbues, as are the mage's scrolls
--             and a shaman's Rockbiter, Flametongue, Frostbrand and Windfury
--             Weapon (the same effect, 360); stones, oils and lures are
--             temporary enchants. Season of Discovery's five poisons
--             (Atrophic, Numbing, Sebacious, Occult I and II) are the
--             exception, effect 54. Left out on every other client, which
--             read the one enchant a hand has (Core.lua, ReadImbue)
--
-- A wizard or mana oil's own data names inventory types (weapon, two-hand,
-- main hand, off hand) where the rest name kinds of weapon, which would take
-- a fishing pole as well; a pole has lures of its own, so an oil is held to
-- every melee weapon (MELEE). Left out: a shaman's imbues, a warlock's
-- firestones and spellstones, the items made for one use (Scourgebane,
-- Bloodboil Poison, Season of Discovery's cleaning cloth and repellent), the
-- coatings that go on a shield (Season of Discovery), the fishing hats, items
-- for the ranged slot, and the placeholders and tests the data still carries
-- (tools/audit_ids.py names every one of them with --notes). A wrong id costs
-- the reminder for that item and never a nag, as everywhere in this file: an
-- item is offered only when the bags hold one.

-- vanilla: what each class puts on itself alone
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The buffs a class can only cast on itself, which "Myself" (Queue.lua,
-- SelfEntry) reminds you of when none of a family is up. Kept apart from the
-- tables above, whose every entry is something to give somebody else: nothing
-- here is offered to anybody but the caster, walked by Automatic, asked for in
-- chat or counted as a favour, and the fields above mean nothing here.
--
-- Per class, a list of families, in the order they are offered (your own
-- group buff, from the tables above, always comes first). A family is the
-- buffs of which only one of yours can be up at once -- a mage's armors, a
-- paladin's auras, a hunter's aspects, a shaman's shields -- and a spell alone
-- is a family of one.
--
--   key       the family's name in the profile (ownBuffs.pick) and in the
--             character's memory of the one last up. Unique across every
--             class, because the profile is shared by every character.
--   label     what a family of several is called on the options page; a
--             family of one goes by its spell's name.
--   spells    each { key, ranks }: ranks highest first, as above, and the key
--             unique across both kinds of table. One spell line may change its
--             name between ranks (Frost Armor becomes Ice Armor at 30, Demon
--             Skin becomes Demon Armor at 20): the macro casts the best rank
--             known by that rank's own name (Core.lua, ProbeBuff).
--             neverAuto on a spell: never what Automatic picks or remembers.
--             talent on a spell: learned from a talent (data only).
--   toggle    stays up until switched off, with no timer (auras, aspects), so
--             never offered as a top-up.
--   dungeon   Automatic's first pick in a dungeon or raid before you have had
--             one up; elsewhere it is the first spell of the family you know.
--   tank      Automatic reminds you only while your group role is tank.
--   shared    a party aura somebody else of your class can put on you too
--             (a paladin's auras, a hunter's aspects and Trueshot), where two
--             of the same do not stack: Automatic passes over one that already
--             reaches you from them for the next you know, and offers nothing
--             when every one does. A pick is offered all the same.
--   charges   on a spell: how many charges a cast gives (a shaman's
--             Lightning Shield, Shadowguard, Inner Fire). With top-ups on,
--             one down to its last few is topped up like one running out.
--   anyCaster on a spell: one of it on you fills the family whoever cast it,
--             since the game allows one of the family on a target (another
--             shaman's Earth Shield, Burning Crusade). Somebody else's reads
--             as the family up, so nothing of yours is offered over it, and
--             is never topped up with yours.
--   castOnOthers on a spell: also cast on somebody else, at a target rather
--             than as an area aura (Earth Shield, on the tank above all). One

--
-- Every id below was checked against Forever's own spell data (EnhanceQoL's
-- SpellRankData_Camelot, generated from build 1.60.1.69913) and Wowhead
-- Classic. Forever added ranks of its own to two spells (Aspect of the Beast
-- and Trueshot Aura, the 1299xxx ids), which no other vanilla client has; they
-- only ever fail to be known there. Water Shield, one rank and so not in that
-- data, was checked against Wowhead Classic and the Forever build of
-- EnhanceQoL's buff reminder, which puts it in the shaman's one shield family.
-- A spell is "known" by these ids alone, so a wrong id costs the reminder,
-- never a nag.
--
-- Vanilla content only: Burning Crusade gave most of these families a member
-- this table does not have (Molten and Fel Armor, Earth Shield, Aspect of the
-- Viper, Crusader Aura), so the tbc set below has a table of its own
-- (TBC_OWN).
--
-- The level each rank of the buffs above is learned at (vanilla trainers), for
-- "skip my own class when they can cast it too": somebody of your class at or
-- past the level of your best rank could give themselves the same, and one
-- below it gets yours, which is better. A buff marked `talent` and a shout
-- are never skipped that way, so their levels are never read; a rank missing
-- here counts as learned at level 1.

-- or by deciphering an untranslated scroll with Comprehend Scroll (both
-- Comprehension spells) -- and reads from the bags, a familiar and a weapon
-- imbue. "For mages, it would be handy to
-- include the mage-specific scroll buffs as reminders", a player on
-- CurseForge. Items, not spells, so Core.lua reads them apart (the scrolls):
-- offered only with one in the bags, at the level it asks for and, for an
-- imbue, on the weapon it fits, and used with /use item:<id> (Prompt/Macro.lua).
-- Every id is the client's own (ItemSparse, ItemXItemEffect, ItemEffect,
-- SpellEffect, SpellEquippedItems and SpellItemEnchantment, build
-- 1.60.1.70532); Rat Familiar, Chillknife and Lesser Flame were also read off
-- a level-12 mage's bags in game.
--
-- Each family is a family as above, with:
--   scroll    its spells are scrolls: { key, item (the item id), level (the
--             level it asks for), ranks = { the spell its use casts } }, best
--             first, which is the order Automatic tries them in before you
--             have used one. The scroll's name is that spell's, as the client
--             names it; nameFromItem takes the item's instead, and is the
--             name until the client has loaded the item.
--   imbue     up is the main hand carrying an enchant of the Imbue kind, a
--             scroll's or any other (never a wizard oil, which is a Temporary
--             one and stays beside it, nor a permanent enchant), rather than
--             an aura (Core.lua, ReadImbue); each scroll names its `enchant`
--             and the `weapon` it fits (the weapon's item subclass).
--   enchantKind  the kind the family's enchants are listed as, as for the
--             weapon enhancements (above). Every scroll's use is SpellEffect
--             360, an imbue (wago.tools, 1.60.1.70532).

-- holds them (every rank, every group version, `alike` ids, an own buff's ranks;

--
-- Where each number comes from, per client, for the build named above its table:
--   SpellMisc.DurationIndex -> SpellDuration.Duration (milliseconds; -1 and 0
--   are no timer), of the spell that puts the aura on. A cast that only triggers
--   the aura (a Blessing of the Bronze, Mists' Legacy of the Emperor) is the

--   spells; Classic Era's are twice as long, and its Blessings five minutes and
--   its Greater Blessings fifteen (Burning Crusade's ten and thirty, Forever's
--   an hour); a shout is two minutes on Classic Era, three on Forever, five on
--   Mists and an hour on retail.

--   Classic builds' SpellItemEnchantment has no duration column, and the use
