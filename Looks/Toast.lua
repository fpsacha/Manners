-- Manners -- the Toast look: a warm banner pinned by a round gilded medallion,
-- in the grammar of the game's own achievement toasts, drawn with restraint.
--
-- A deep warm brown banner, framed by a thin rail of old gold with a darker
-- line inside it and a small stud in each corner. A round medallion pins its
-- left end: the spell icon, a thin gold ring hugging it, a band of enamel in
-- the reason colour (darkened, as fired enamel is), and a fine gold rim, so
-- the enamel lies between two lines of gold, as cloisonne does. The name
-- is the title, the reason the subtitle. It is still at rest; it moves when
-- something happens, and briefly.
--
-- The rules it keeps since 1.5.2, after 1.5.1 wore in the game a glaring
-- yellow line all round, a square bevelled frame round the icon and a bright
-- blue glow ring (tests/scenarios/look-toast.lua and readable-toast.lua):
--   * no additive light at rest. tools/render_prompt.py draws ADD far more
--     gently than the client does, so light that stays on screen is baked
--     into the art or drawn with BLEND in colours given here, and the preview
--     shows what the game shows. Only a flourish -- the rails' glints for a
--     new favour, the ring of light as it arrives, the flare and the burst
--     of a landed buff -- is ADD, and each is gone within 0.6 s;
--   * the gold is old gold, never brighter than 0.62, thin and crisp;
--   * the medallion is round, made of flat discs drawn UNDER the icon, so
--     nothing lies over the icon at all and each ring is a set number of UI
--     units wide at any height (the gold ring 1.5 to 2.5);
--   * the text stands on dark: the body under the lines is a deep brown at
--     full strength, and nothing is drawn under the lines but the body.
--
-- Every region is a texture from Textures/Toast (tools/make_toast_textures.py).
-- The gold is baked, because it is decoration; everything that means something
-- -- the enamel, the list's gems, the favour clock, the outcome -- is white or
-- grey art coloured by SetVertexColor, so one file serves all six reasons,
-- both palettes, a custom marker colour and the outcomes. The interface this
-- file implements is described at the top of Looks/Looks.lua.
--
-- Kept from the approved design (design14/toast/SPEC.md) and the judges' word:
--   * the rails' glints only for a new favour, never for every new face; a
--     new face gets the text's own dip and nothing else;
--   * below height 40 a finer frame, so the gilding does not turn to mush;
--   * the text at its regular weight, the hierarchy carried by size, ink and
--     shadow;
--   * the result as a verdict on the second line -- "buffed" with a tick, or
--     the game's own words with a cross -- and the name left where it was;
--   * the favour clock: a thin line in the reason colour, lighter than the
--     enamel, over a line of ash along the bottom rail, burning down as the
--     time to return the favour runs out. Brought up to date on the scan's
--     own repaint, never on a frame script; kept under Calm, because it is
--     information, and in a fight, dimmed;
--   * the bound key on a chip at the right, the count's chip beside it (never
--     on the medallion, where it covered the icon). Either chip steps aside
--     for a paint in which the name would otherwise be cut;
--   * the owed enamel breathes three times and then settles;
--   * a fight turns the gold to iron and greys the icon, the text dims, and
--     the enamel keeps its colour: the one coloured thing left is the reason;
--   * the medallion is the panel's height and stays inside the button, so the
--     whole look takes clicks and the drag and the screen clamp see what the
--     player sees; the icon is sized by the height (Options says so);
--   * the owed gold fired to a honey amber, so it never reads as more metal;
--   * with the icon off, a jewel at the banner's end carries the reason;
--   * the icon is round whatever "Round the icon off" says, as "stripe" is
--     "both" here: a squared icon in a round medallion sat in a dark hole,
--     the ring round only its corners, and read as a square dropped into a
--     porthole. Round, it fills the ring, which hugs it;
--   * a class-coloured name is taken a third of the way to white.
