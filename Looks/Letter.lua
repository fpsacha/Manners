-- Manners -- the Letter look: the prompt as a letter sealed in wax.
--
-- Not a bar. A sheet of warm parchment, mottled and burnt at its edges, rolled
-- onto a wooden rod at each end (the rods stand a little taller than the sheet),
-- and at its left a round seal of red wax with the spell pressed into it: the
-- wax has a blobby edge, a raised lip and an embossed ring, and the icon sits in
-- its recess, cut round. The name is written in dark ink, the reason under it in
-- a lighter brown, and between the two lines runs a thin stroke of ink. Fully
-- opaque and light: the one look that is not dark, so its text is dark ink and
-- its panel colour only tints the paper (never darker than a parchment can be).
--
-- Where the reason lives:
--   * the colour of the wax, with the marker's mode "icon" or "both" (red for
--     somebody owed, as a letter's seal is, and each of the other reasons its own
--     wax; both palettes have their own set; a custom marker colour is the wax
--     itself). With "stripe" or "off" the seal is the classic red;
--   * the thin stroke of ink between the lines, in the palette's colour taken dark
--     enough to read on paper, with the marker's mode "stripe" or "both", and the
--     reason line's ink leaning towards it;
--   * a drop of wax in each row of the list.
--
-- It moves in the idiom of a letter, and rests still:
--   * arriving: the scroll unrolls, the paper widening out from the seal and the
--     right rod running out to its end, and the seal presses down (on Calm the
--     panel only fades in, which is Prompt's entrance);
--   * owed: a warm light like a candle's breathes on the seal, three breaths and
--     still;
--   * landed: the seal flashes gold and a warm light passes over the paper;
--   * refused: the seal flares red and amber and cracks, and the scroll shakes a
--     little (the text's shake is Prompt's);
--   * in a fight: the whole letter goes dim, and the ink stays dark enough to read;
--   * the global cooldown: the sweep runs round the seal's icon.
-- "Calm" is fades only: nothing loops, nothing moves.
--
-- Every region is a texture from Textures/Letter (tools/make_letter_textures.py),
-- none of the client's. The colour of the paper and the wood is baked; the wax,
-- its rim, the drops, the ink stroke and the lights are grey or white art that
-- SetVertexColor colours, so one file serves every wax colour, both palettes, a
-- custom marker colour and the outcomes. The interface this file implements is
-- described at the top of Looks/Looks.lua.
--
-- Rules it keeps:
--   * the whole letter is inside the prompt's width and height (the secure
--     button covers the prompt, so all of it takes clicks and the drag): the
--     rods, the paper and the seal fit the box, with a margin that is the room a
--     refusal's shake takes; only a list hangs outside, as it does on every look;
--   * the text never reaches the seal or the rods, and stands on the paper's
--     middle, away from its burnt edge and the shade where it curls into a rod;
--   * the effects are in their room: the seal's pop never passes the box, the
--     light is under the text, nothing is lit for long (three breaths and a
--     rest; a flourish is gone within 0.6 s);
--   * the icon is always round, whatever "Round the icon off" says, and the
--     seal sizes it from the prompt's height (Options says so);
--   * the ink: dark brown on parchment, at 4.5:1 or more, a class-coloured name
--     taken dark enough to read (Prompt/Paint.lua, classContrast).
