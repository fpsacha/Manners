-- Manners -- the "In character" phrase set.
--
-- The other sets are a list of lines the player can read and edit in the phrase
-- box. This one is chosen at the moment of the click instead, from lines written
-- for the player's own people and side, and for why the buff is going out:
-- thanking somebody who buffed you first, answering somebody who asked, or
-- offering it unasked. A dwarf says something a dwarf would say.
--
-- And it listens to the moment, which is where the best lines come from: the
-- speaker's class, the spell going out, the spell they gave you when this is a
-- thank-you (and what that spell does), how often the two of you have traded
-- this session, whether this is a city, the wilds, a dungeon or a battlefield,
-- the hour (and whether it is the speaker's people's hour), and the class of
-- the person being helped. Each of those is a pool of lines below; a pool
-- joins the draw only when the moment is known to be its moment, and anything
-- the client will not say (a secret, a missing function, a throw) simply
-- leaves its pool out. See RP.Pick for how the pools are weighed against each
-- other, and for the short memory that keeps a line from being heard twice in
-- a row.
--
-- It is active while "In character" is the chosen set and the box still holds
-- the examples it put there; editing the box makes the lines the player's own,
-- as editing any set does. Speech.lua's ns.PickPhrase and ns.PhraseSetText ask this
-- file, and do exactly what they did before whenever it is not the chosen set,
-- or not loaded at all.
--
-- Somebody else's race is asked for one thing, whether they are kin, and their
-- class for one more, which lines about helping their class apply; on this
-- client both are often secrets, and then neither is used.
--
-- Adding lines: every line is a whole L["..."] literal in the pool it belongs
-- to, in the shape the tables below already have. A pool may hold any number;
-- more lines add variety, not airtime (see RP.SPREAD). {name} is their short
-- name and {buff} the spell going out; {gift} is for RP.TRADE and RP.GIFT
-- alone, the only pools that join when somebody has given you something.

-- Read through a proxy that remembers each translation's English key, because
-- the box keeps whatever language it was filled in: a player who picks the set
-- before the lines are translated has English examples saved, and they must
-- still count as untouched once a later release translates them. The proxy
-- only forwards: every key reaching it is written below as a whole L["..."]
-- literal, which is what the translation audit collects.
--
-- A line reworded in English may be translated as it was, and then the new
-- and the old English are one text. The pools are read before RP.LEGACY, so
-- ENGLISH_NOW keeps the first key read, for the pools as they are, and
-- ENGLISH the last, for the pools before the rewording (RP.BEFORE) and what
-- RP.LEGACY holds.

-- UnitRace's second return, the untranslated file name, to the people whose

-- had lines of their own since 1.7.2, written from what Blizzard has published
-- of them (warcraft.wiki.gg's Haranir and Harandar pages and the quests they
-- cite); a race missing here speaks with its faction's voice and the general
-- lines, which is better than guessing at a culture. The file name is the
-- client's ChrRaces.ClientFileString, not the race's name: "Scourge" for the
-- Forsaken, "EarthenDwarf" for the Earthen, and "Harronir" for the Haranir
-- (wago.tools ChrRaces 86 and 91; Blizzard's own glue screens say HARRONIR).

-- Each people's lines by what the moment is: "thanks" for returning a favour,
-- "asked" for answering a request, "offer" for a buff nobody asked for, "group"
-- for somebody in your own party -- no road, no stranger, no "well met" to a
-- person you have fought beside for an hour -- and "kin" for somebody of the
-- same people. A people with the hour in its bones (the night elves' night,
-- the pandaren's breakfast) has "night" or "morning" lines too, heard next to
-- everybody's at that hour (RP.TIME). A people with a city of its own in
-- RP.HOME may have "city" lines, said there in place of anybody's (RP.PLACE),
-- and "outsider" lines, by moment, about how other peoples take to it, which
-- join that moment's lines for somebody who is not kin, away from home. A kin
-- line joins whichever of the others is being said, so it greets nobody:
-- "well met" is wrong to somebody who just buffed you. No line says "buff"
-- either -- the set is in character, and {buff} is the spell's own name.
--
-- The first few lines of a pool are the phrase box's examples (RP.Examples
-- says how many of which), and a box players have saved is recognised by
-- them: reword or reorder those and every box saved with them reads as the
-- player's own lines, and In character stops. Add new lines after them, and
-- a reworded example goes into RP.LEGACY.reworded as it read before.
-- RP.LEGACY also keeps the lines beta.9 saved, which have been rewritten since.

	"Stand behind me, {name}. Aye, I know. Crouch a bit.",
	"Stand where the light is good, {name}. If we must fight, we'll look splendid.",
	"Stay alive, {name}. Undercity's housing list is already very long.",
	"Stay among the living a little longer, {name}.",
	"Stay away from da voodoo, {name}. Except this one. This one's fine.",
	"Stay close, {name}. A haranir needs something to guard, and today it's you.",
	"Stay close, {name}. The whispers are much quieter in company.",
	"Stay close, {name}. Trolls regenerate; da rest of ya gotta be careful.",
	"Stay in formation, {name}. We haven't got one, but stay in it anyway.",
	"Stay near, {name}. I lost a world once; I'm keeping hold of this party.",

	"Such warmth, for one so cold? Returned in full, {name}.",
	"Suramar's children shine together again, {name}.",
	"Sure thing, {name}. Hold still; mojo hates a movin' target.",
	"Sure, {name}! Let me dig it out... rope, rocks, a nice rock... here it is!",
	"Take it, {name}, I've a spare. I've three spares of everything.",
	"Take this, {name}, and may Aln'hara be with you.",
	"Take this, {name}, from a long way below. The roots send their regards.",
	"Take this, {name}. A grummle would sell it to you for a luckydo.",
	"Take this, {name}. And perhaps a cup of tea afterward?",
	"Take this, {name}. Any tentacles you see are purely decorative.",
	"Take this, {name}. Arcane gifts are wasted on the idle.",
	"Take this, {name}. Elves have centuries to be generous; I've got fifty years.",
	"Take this, {name}. Even a dragon needs allies. Especially one this size.",
	"Take this, {name}. I meant to explain the spell first. Too late now.",
	"Take this, {name}. I'd add bread, but conjured bread tastes of nothing.",
	"Take this, {name}. My people always travel Light.",

	"Take this, {name}. The grave can wait.",
	"Take this, {name}. The storm doesn't know you yet, but I've introduced you.",
	"Take this, {name}. Whatever happens out there is merely a setback.",
	"Tell me when to breathe fire, {name}. And, please, when not to.",
	"Thank ye kindly, {name}! First round's on me when we're back at the forge.",
	"Thank ye, {name}! I'd have been fine without it, mind. But thank ye.",
	"Thank you, {name}! The caravan always repays a kindness. Usually in string.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Aysa would bow, Ji would cheer. I will do both, badly.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Elune smiles on the generous.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Even the wisps glow brighter, and they're hard to impress.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Few give gifts to someone who glows this ominously.",
	"Thank you, {name}. I haven't felt this radiant since... well, this morning.",
	"Thank you, {name}. I'd blush, but the blood stopped reaching my face.",
	"Thank you, {name}. I'd knight you, but apparently I 'need permission'.",
	"Thank you, {name}. I'm deeply moved, and it takes a lot to move a tauren.",
	"Thank you, {name}. If worgen had tails, mine would be wagging.",
	"Thank you, {name}. It would warm my heart, if it still beat.",
	"Thank you, {name}. May the winds guide you.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Returned on swift wings.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Ten thousand years under a dome; I'm still practising that.",
	"Thank you, {name}. The voices approve of you, which is frankly alarming.",
	"Thank you, {name}. Where I come from, a kindness is tended like a root.",
	"Thank you, {name}. You have my gratitude, and my best howl.",
	"Thank you, {name}. You have restored my balance.",
	"Thanks for the buff, {name}!",
	"Thanks, mon! Da spirits smile on ya, {name}.",
	"Thanks, {name}! Consider your account settled in full.",
	"Thanks, {name}! Here's yours back. Well, a new one. Hardly used.",
	"Thanks, {name}! I checked it for fine print. There wasn't any. Weird!",
	"Thanks, {name}! I'd build you a thank-you machine, but it'd explode.",
	"Thanks, {name}! Kindness received, catalogued and returned!",
	"Thanks, {name}. I'd offer a lift in the Exodar, but you've seen how it lands.",
	"The Earth Mother saw your kindness, {name}. She nudged me. Quite hard.",
	"The Earth Mother watches over us both, {name}.",
	"The Forbidden Reach feels far behind us now, {name}.",
	"The Legion's been at this world for ten thousand years, {name}. It hasn't won yet.",
	"The Light asks nothing in return, {name}. I, however, accept thanks.",
	"The Light is with you, {name}. Go in peace, or at least go prepared.",
	"The Light rewards kindness, {name}. I'm simply its fastest courier.",
	"The Scourge is always recruiting, {name}. Don't give them the satisfaction.",
	"The Sunwell shines for us both, {name}.",
	"The Titans shaped this world, {name}. Keeping it whole falls to the likes of us.",
	"The curse binds us, {name}, but Gilneas binds us tighter.",
	"The dead keep terrible hours, {name}. Nice to have company for once.",
	"The dome kept us safe, {name}. Now we must make do with one another. Gladly.",
	"The herd moves together, {name}. Mind my hooves; the herd has learned to.",
	"The horn sounds for you, {name}. It used to sound only for the Scourge.",
	"The jinyu say the waters foretold this, {name}. They say that a lot.",
	"The moon's up, {name}. For a kaldorei, this is the middle of the morning.",
	"The naaru would call this a fellowship, {name}. I call it good luck.",
	"The plan, {name}: we hit it. Questions? No? Good plan.",
	"The road ahead is long, {name}. This won't shorten it, but it'll help.",
	"The shadows remember kindness, {name}. So do I.",
	"The sky has a little fury to spare, {name}. Take some.",
	"The sky has no ceiling, {name}. Anything could fall on you. Take this.",
	"The sun has risen, {name}, and so have I. We coordinate.",
	"The world outside the dome is so large, {name}. And so under-enchanted. Here.",
	"This one's on me, {name}.",
	"This one's on the house, {name}. Don't tell the Trade Prince.",
	"Throm-ka, {name}! Honour is repaid.",
	"Throm-ka, {name}! The blood of the clans runs strong in you.",
	"Together we stand, {name}. For the Alliance!",
	"Top-shelf stuff, zero fees, {name}. Today only!",
	"Twenty-five thousand years on the run, {name}. Walking with friends is nicer.",
	"Two haranir out in the world, {name}. No wonder the elders are up in arms.",
	"Up before the tea, {name}? Brave. Here, instead of the tea.",
	"Velen foresaw you asking, {name}. I foresaw saying yes.",
	"Very well, {name}. Stand still, I would hate to singe you.",
	"Walk carefully in the dark places, {name}.",
	"Walk in the Light, {name}. May it shelter you always.",
	"Walk with the Earth Mother, {name}. She's everywhere, so you can't get lost.",
	"Watch the long grass in Stranglethorn, {name}. The panthers are watching you.",
	"We Forsaken must look after each other, {name}.",
	"We go in together, {name}, we come out together. That's the plan, mon.",
	"We have to stop meeting like this, {name}. Actually, no, we don't.",
	"We look after our own, {name}. Always, mon.",
	"We move as one, {name}. Slowly, perhaps, but as one.",
	"We must share a brew when the road allows, {name}!",
	"We once mastered every beast on our mountain, {name}. These won't take long.",
	"We ren'dorei look after our own, {name}.",
	"We split the take even, {name}. I'll do the maths. Trust me.",
	"We vulpera travel by night, {name}. Cool sand, sleepy scorpids.",
	"Wings, fire and scales, {name}, and still you thought I needed help. Touching.",
	"With pleasure, {name}. A kind deed is never wasted.",
	"Word from Harandar, {name}: the haranir are ready to join the fight.",
	"Ya gave me good mojo, {name}. Now ya get some back, extra spicy.",
