-- Manners -- options window: the look picker, a gallery of cards. Added to the
-- kinds Widgets.lua started; see there for what a row is.
--
-- The layout places the model's Panel style (a select) with widget = "themes",
-- and this draws it in place of the dropdown: one card per look the registry
-- holds, in the dropdown's order (the dropdown is made from the same list), so
-- a look registered in Looks/ has a card with nothing more done (Looks.Card
-- says what it is called and how it is described). A card is a
-- picture of the look, its name and its line; the chosen one has a gold edge
-- and a tick, the one under the pointer a lighter edge, and a click sets the
-- control as the dropdown's pick does (Bind.Commit: the profile's style, then
-- Prompt:ApplyStyle, which waits for the end of a fight as every change on
-- this page does).
--
-- The pictures are Textures/Previews/Preview_<key>.tga, drawn by
-- tools/make_look_previews.py from the real look code on the mock client. They
-- are not live: a look keeps its regions on the one secure prompt and its text
-- layout in Prompt's own tables, so a second copy of one painting in a card is
-- not something the code can do, and nothing here touches the prompt but the
-- setting itself. So nothing in a card is secure, nothing runs on a timer, and
-- there is no OnUpdate to stop when the window closes. A look the tool has not
-- drawn has a card with the addon's icon where the picture goes.
--
-- Two things on a card are live, laid over the picture. The first is the spell icon. The picture holds a tile
-- where the look draws it (the tool has no game art), and a texture over the
-- picture, at the rectangle the tool recorded for that look (Looks.PreviewIcon),
-- shows the icon of the buff this character casts, cropped as the prompt crops
-- it. The client draws it; no spell art is in any file of the addon. A look
-- that cuts its icon round (Toast, Ribbon, Letter) has the same mask file on the
-- overlay; the others are square, as they are in the picture. A client without
-- mask textures (none of the five) draws them square. The texture is set when
-- the page is painted, so an icon the client had not loaded yet is there the
-- next time the page is drawn.
--
-- The second is the text. The pictures carry none (the tool leaves the
-- name and the reason line out of them), because a picture has one language.
-- Two font strings over each picture, at the rectangles the tool recorded for the
-- look's two lines (Looks.PreviewText), write a sample name, "Anna Aim", which is
-- a name and so the same in every language, and the reason a prompt gives for
-- somebody who buffed you in the client's own words (L["buffed you"], the
-- prompt's default for it, so no string is new). Each is written as the look
-- writes that line: its face where the looks use it (a Latin client, the player's
-- font the default one) else the prompt's own font, its size, colour, shadow and
-- outline, the size scaled with the picture. A line wider than its rectangle is
-- drawn up to a fifth smaller, then cut by the client, as the prompt's are. Set
-- when the page is painted and laid out; nothing is per frame.
--
-- A look that sets its reason line in a tag of its own (Luxe's pill) has the tag
-- drawn live as well, round the live words: baked into the picture it was the
-- English words' width, and a German or Korean reason ran past it. The tool
-- records the tag with the line (`pill`: its edges, how far it reaches past the
-- words on either side, its caps, and its layers, each the look's own file as a
-- horizontal three-slice in the look's colour), and the card lays those textures
-- over the picture, under the words, as wide as the words it has just measured.
--
-- Two or three cards to a row, as many as the page is wide enough for, every
-- row as tall as its tallest card.
