-- Manners -- core: the addon object, secret-safe access, failure handling,
-- defaults and their repair, the capability probe, which buff for which
-- person, unit inspection, names, and the lifecycle with its events.
--
-- Blizzard will not let an addon cast a spell on its own: CastSpellByName and
-- friends are protected and only run from a hardware event. So this addon does
-- every part of the job except the keypress -- it decides who deserves a buff
-- and parks that decision on a secure button. Prompt/ owns that button; this
-- file and the eight after it in Manners.toc work out what goes on it:
--
--   Range.lua      how near a passer-by has to be
--   Speech.lua     the phrase sets and the line said with a click
--   Queue.lua      debts, refusals, the never-offer list, friends, BuildQueue
--   GroupBuffs.lua one cast for a whole party in place of single casts
--   Requests.lua   people who ask for a buff in chat
--   Favours.lua    noticing that somebody buffed you
--   Clicks.lua     what became of a press, the global cooldown, the macro
--   Commands.lua   first run, test console, snooze, sharing, slash commands
--
-- A local one of them needs from another goes on ns where it is defined: a
-- later file copies it into a local at load, an earlier one (this, for the
-- lifecycle) reads it off ns at call time. "Core" in another file means this
-- file and those eight.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- secret-safe access
--
-- The protection policy. On Forever and retail most API calls hand back a
-- secret rather than throw, so a result is made safe with plain(), which
-- turns a secret into nil ("cannot tell"), and the call itself is not
-- wrapped. A function that may be missing gets a type() check on the global,
-- read at call time.
--
-- pcall is only for calls that can throw:
--   - the aura reads the client restricts per spell. These keep a bare inline
--     pcall per read, never safecall, behind the aura cache;
--   - third-party library code (LibRangeCheck);
--   - calls handed a value that may be secret, such as a GUID;
--   - APIs whose signature differs between client generations;
--   - macro and settings setup.
--
-- Everything else on a busy path (per unit, per event, per repaint) calls the
-- client directly: type check, call, then plain() on each return it uses.
-- safecall costs about 310 ns a call against about 45 ns for the direct form,
-- so it is for once-per-scan and UI-rate calls, where it costs nothing
-- measurable.
--
-- ns.Guard stays at event, timer and module boundaries: one pcall per event,
-- about 80 ns. One fault is then named in /manners errors and never stops the
-- scanner. A throw inside the scan is caught there, not read as "cannot tell".
--
-- tests/scenarios/perf-budget.lua holds the scan to this on every client: a
-- budget of pcalls, calls to the client and memory per scan for each place
-- (a city is about 10 pcalls, a raid 14).

--   long before it ends"), so a profile that said 3 minutes keeps 3 at most,
--   then by who it is for:
--     your group          as it is
--     a raid or a dungeon times `refreshRaid` (two), where you are in one
--     your own buffs      one and a half times (you are not in reach of the

--     somebody not in your group   half a minute, never more
--   and never more than half of the buff's length, or a top-up would be due
--   the moment it was cast (a three-minute shout, a five-minute blessing).
-- A length nobody knows (no row, or a table of 0 on an aura that has a timer)
-- is the ceiling alone, as every buff was before.
--
-- Worked out per (kind, length) and kept: the memo is dropped when the ceiling
-- or the raid multiplier changes, which is the only time it could differ, so a
