--
-- A record of what the addon has done for you: who buffed you, with what and
-- when, whether you returned it and with what, and who you buffed without being
-- asked. The recent entries are listed in a small window (/manners ledger), under
-- the lifetime counts, which the minimap tooltip and the General tab repeat.
--
-- It is a record and never a decision. Core tells it what happened at the
-- four moments a favour changes hands -- noticed, repaid, refused after all, and
-- let go -- and nothing reads a ledger entry to decide what to offer or whom to
-- cast at: the debt table in Queue.lua is the one opinion about who is owed. So
-- the ledger may only ever be wrong by missing something, and one that throws
-- takes nothing with it, because Core calls it through Guard.
--
-- The window is plain UI with no secure frame anywhere in it, so unlike the
-- prompt it can be opened, scrolled, cleared and dragged in a fight.
