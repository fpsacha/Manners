-- passers-by, remembered
--
-- Friendly nameplates are off by default, so for most players a stranger is
-- found by the cursor alone: "mouseover" is the one token that reaches them,
-- and it goes the moment the cursor leaves them for the prompt. The next scan
-- had nobody, the empty-queue fuse took the prompt down, and the offer
-- vanished on the way to being clicked, every time (a CurseForge report on
-- 1.1.0). With nameplates on, somebody pacing the edge of "Passers-by within"
-- blinked on and off the same way.
--
-- So a passer-by offered through a token nobody pointed at -- the cursor, a
-- nameplate -- is remembered by name, and for a few seconds after the last
-- token reached them is offered as the owed fallback offers a favour: no
-- token, the macro's /target line, range unknown. A cast on somebody who has
-- walked off is refused, and the back-off (NoteRefusal) lets them go. Only
-- plain data is kept, never a unit token, which may name somebody else by then.
--
-- Somebody who asked in chat is remembered the same way while the request
-- stands: a request names a person, not a unit. Somebody who buffed you longer
-- ago than "Let them go after" is offered by the owed fallback again for the
-- same few seconds after a token last reached them (`near` on the debt): being
-- found is evidence of reach as good as a fresh favour.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How long after the last token reached them. Reaching the prompt and reading
-- it takes a second or two; somebody running off at seven yards a second
-- leaves a buff's thirty yards in about three, somebody standing about far
-- later. Ten covers the trip, and a runner costs one refused cast; longer

-- "nearby" or "asked" -- and `within` the "Passers-by within" step that
