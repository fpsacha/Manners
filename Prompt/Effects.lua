-- Manners -- the prompt's animations: the entrance, the text's cross-fade and
-- shake, the favour's glow and sweep, a landed buff's rings and light, the fade
-- out after the last buff, the cooldown sweep and the dim for a fight.
--
-- Every gesture means one thing and moves one way:
--   * the panel COMING UP unfurls (the three looks drawn here): it rises as
--     two rules of light draw out from the icon along its top and bottom
--     edges, and the words arrive a beat behind them (under 0.5 s);
--   * a favour ARRIVING converges: the icon's echo drops onto it and a bloom
--     of the reason's light gathers round its ring, and a glint runs the two
--     rules from the icon to the panel's end (under 0.5 s);
--   * a buff LANDING strikes and radiates: rings spread from the icon, the
--     panel's edge lights in the reason's colour, a wave of the same light
--     bursts from the icon's edge across the panel, the glow flares, the panel
--     settles and the outcome's wash fades rather than cuts (under 0.7 s);
--   * a REFUSAL breaks the ward: a red-amber ring snaps in on the icon, the
--     edge flashes red, the ground cracks along the bottom band under the
--     words, the top rule sputters, the icon greys for the outcome and the
--     text shakes its head, the shakes dying away (under 0.5 s);
--   * somebody OWED breathes: the reason's light and a warm white rim, a slow
--     2.4 s breath, never a flash.
-- All of it plays on frames of the art, which is not protected: nothing here
-- touches the secure button or the rows, in a fight or out of one. Nothing is
-- polled; every group is started by an event (an arrival, an outcome, a
-- cooldown) and parks what it lit at nothing when it ends or is stopped.
-- "Calm" is fades only: no scale, no shake, no rings, no light across.
