-- The button is a SecureActionButtonTemplate: Blizzard owns the click, and its
-- attributes, size, scale and position are protected in combat. Every visual
-- lives on `art`, an ordinary child frame, so animations never touch protected
-- state. Everything is drawn from one white texture plus gradients, alpha and
-- motion: a missing atlas or art file renders as a green placeholder, and a
-- solid texture cannot fail.
--
-- One file for all of it came to 172 of the 200 locals Lua 5.1 allows a main
-- chunk and 45 of the 60 upvalues it allows a function (beta.6 went over the
-- second and did not load at all), so it is split by concern, loaded in this
-- order from Manners.toc:
--
--   Prompt.lua   the tables the files share, the reason colours, drawing helpers
--   Text.lua     text made legible on the panel's ground and fitted to its room
--   Effects.lua  the animations
--   Hold.lua     the hysteresis: the hold, the empty-queue fuse, the cursor
--   Macro.lua    what the button casts, and at whom
--   Press.lua    PreClick and PostClick
--   Button.lua   the button's other scripts: the drag, the cursor, the tooltip
--   Panel.lua    the panel built and styled; the three looks drawn here
--   List.lua     the list of who is next
--   Rows.lua     each name in that list as a button to press
--   Paint.lua    the words on the panel, and a click's outcome over them
--   Refresh.lua  the repaint, and the preview
--
-- They share three tables, kept on ns.Prompt: `state` (S in every file), what
-- more than one of them reads or writes; `regions` (R), the panel's frames and
-- textures; and `lib`, the helpers one file defines and a later one calls,
-- copied into a local at load.
