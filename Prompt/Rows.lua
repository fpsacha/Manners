-- Manners -- the names in the list as buttons: a left click on a name buffs
-- that person exactly as if they had been on the prompt and the prompt had
-- been pressed.
--
-- WHY EACH NAME IS A BUTTON OF ITS OWN, AND NOT A DELEGATE OF THE PROMPT
--
-- The tempting design is a row of type "click" whose clickbutton is the
-- prompt: the row's PreClick says who, and the prompt's own PreClick and
-- PostClick do the rest, so nothing about the macro is written twice. Blizzard's
-- secure code (Gethe/wow-ui-source, branch forever, Blizzard_FrameXML/
-- SecureTemplates.lua) rules it out for this button:
--
--   * SECURE_ACTIONS.click (line 557) runs `delegate:Click(button)` and hands
--     on the mouse button only. Button:Click(button, isDown) takes the phase
--     as its second argument and defaults it to false (the Click entry of
--     Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/SimpleButtonAPIDocumentation.lua), so
--     the delegate always receives an up click, whatever phase the row was
--     pressed in.
--   * The prompt is registered for "AnyDown" with pressAndHoldAction set, the
--     one configuration known to cast on this client (Panel.lua; CHANGELOG
--     1.2.0 and 1.3.0: an up delivery casts nothing here). SecureActionButton_
--     OnClick (line 802) takes useOnKeyDown as true under pressAndHoldAction
--     for any click that is not a secure mouse press, a scripted Click()
--     among them (its own comment says so), so an up click is not the action
--     but the release, and the release looks up `typerelease`, which the
--     prompt does not carry (it would run the macro a second time on every
--     real press).
--
-- So a delegate would be handed a click that casts nothing. Instead each row
-- is registered and silenced exactly as the prompt is (the same trio, the same
-- wildcards) and armed by the same routine, Macro.lua's Arm, from the same
-- STRATEGIES: the macro of a press on a name is the macro of a press on the
-- prompt, because it is built by the same code, and a click on a row is
-- handled by the client exactly as a click on the prompt is. Its press is
-- filed by the same OnPostClick (Press.lua), with the row's slot standing in
-- for the prompt's state.
--
-- A row holds no macro at rest. PreClick arms it, for the length of one press,
-- from a fresh queue; PostClick files the press and lets it go. So there is
-- nothing to keep in step with the repaints, nothing a fight can freeze (the
-- secure attributes cannot change in combat, and a row with none does
-- nothing), and nothing that can be left aimed at somebody: DisarmRows lets go
-- of anything a cut-short press left, at the start of a fight, and a row armed
-- for longer than a press can take is let go on the next repaint.
--
-- The rows are children of the prompt's button, so they go when it goes, and
-- their click areas hang off the list's own font strings: whichever way a look
-- lays the list out (built-in, above or below, or a look's own PaintQueue), the
-- area follows the text it covers. A row with nobody on it is hidden.
